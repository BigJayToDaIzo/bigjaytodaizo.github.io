### Why thefuck would I name my post this way

Again, the second post has you wondering RIGHT out of the gate ['thefuck](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/thefuck/)is this guy doing naming his second ever in history blog post "The fuck"'?

I want to tell you about that too. But after some sleep so I can really dive in about how that small, fast free application has saved me HUNDREDS of keystrokes today alone and how it can save you thousands or hundreds of thousands over a life time, so get started now. Seriously go google 'arch thefuck' and laugh with me on[twitch](https://twitch.tv/thiccjaygaming)or discord. LMAO
