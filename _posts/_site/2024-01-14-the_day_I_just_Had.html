<p>I am anxious to wake up and code EVERY night when I go to bed now. I’m actually excited to get back into neovim and learn more about markdown, Shopify Liquid implementation of the Jekyll framework Github recommends you use to manage your free usernamehere.github.io website.</p>

<p>Of course that is just last nights specific iteration of what I go through. The night before my focus was on getting up and learning Lua, because from what little lua scripting I’ve already done to trick out the current build has me seeing how incredibly powerful and terse it is to accomplish things. There’s not a lot of braces and brackets getting in the way. The almighty truth, the TABLE. It is such an incredibly powerful way to take in, analyze information, and pass right back out again is truly a fun experience to master. I am only currently Padiwan level in Lua mastery, but she pours her gifts of knowledge nugget abundantly when I read her documentation and the S+ tier examples for how it might apply to my goal. THE WHOLE POINT before I get all long winded, is that I go to bed excited to get back to coding on whatever I was working on the night before.</p>

<p>NEOVIM, is both slowing the fuck out of, and yet propelling forward that learning (I’ll explain shortly) that way learning NEOVIM slows down my coding is making the understanding of WHAT THE FK I AM TYPING is actually doing. Instead of speed regurgitating what I’m reading onto the screen, I’m FORCED to type it TRULY slowly and deliberately. One because typing mistakes while learning NEOVIM are COSTLY (it’s easy for short sets of keystrokes to do some pretty wild shit to your document). And I think it’s the reason so many people TRY it but get so wildly frustrated by the experience and rapidly retreat. But SLOWLY learning both a language close to the kernel AND a completely new method of working my way around my desktop without EVER needing (or it being faster) to use the mouse.</p>

<p>That’s it. That’s the entire goal. Is to learn how to move code around in my IDE in a way SO incredibly efficient, that I can get my work and ideas out into production as rapidly and free of error as humanly possible.</p>

<p>THE point being learning neovim and motions slowing me down has made topics sink in SO MUCH HARDER because having to type very carefully and deliberately gives concepts more time to CLICK. Make sense?</p>

<p>Would I recommend you skip the neovim route so you can keep using your vs-code and various jetbrains plugins that cost money and steal your data? No, I would not. Should you NOT rice out a base arch-64 install and craft a truly remarkable work and play environment if you refuse to learn vim motions? Also no. You definitely should. We welcome the dark siders who avoid vim. We understand balance. We thrive for it. But those of use who do not FEEL that balance can probably find it learning the vim motions way. If you want to really be free of that progress destroying mouse, join us.</p>

<p>LUL, no gate keeping here. But you will get opinions!</p>

<p>Love, JM</p>
