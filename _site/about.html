<p>Yo check this out, we busted out the gate towards Mordor, erm I mean Arch Linux and it is a grand thing we took such a HEARTY and DIVERSE party to deal with the dragon yo, but here we are. Let me take you on the adventure where I fought a dragon and won!</p>

<p>Stay tuned for actual information about me in the days to come. I want to spend roughly one hour each evening before bed organizing my thoughts, and I want to curate a topics section where folks looking for help can just head straight to topics and see what I (and others) have to say about various topics. There are a plethora topics to consider when building a custom linux build. But we will get into that in the days to come.</p>

<p>Love, JM</p>
