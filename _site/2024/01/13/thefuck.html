 <h1>Thefuck</h1>
<p>13 Jan 2024 - jm</p>
<p>Again, the second post has you wonering RIGHT out of the gate ‘thefuck is this guy doing naming his second ever in history blog title ‘the fuck’’</p>

<p>I want to tell you about that too. But after some sleep so I can really dive in about how many HOURS that small, fast free application has saved me HUNDREDS of keystrokes today alone and how it can save you thousounds or hundreds of thousands over a life time so get started now. Seriously go google ‘arch thefuck’ and laugh with me on twitch or discord. LMAO</p>
