# READ THE FRIENDLY MANUAL DAWGS! For real. It's where you're eventually going to find your answers after frustratingly trying to make it work from a youtube vide. Read it. It's worth it.

PUBLIC Source NOT OPEN Source. This is for me. If you can use it GREAT! If it breaks your doodoo, too bad. Should have read the manual instead. Let's make cool things together!

Also, you can see the blog here [website](https://bigjaytodaizo.github.io).
