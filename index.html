<h1>{{ "@dN" | downcase }}</h1>
<p>
  Other than being the hostname of my computer, do not let @dn confuse you. It's
  just a random name I came up with when installing void and arch linux over and
  over and over. I got tired of typing long hostnames like
  jays_super_awesome_I_use_Arch_BTW_box so I eneded up settling on @dn.

  I hope you'll find something valuable here. My first wish is that you find
  something useful here to help you learn. And if you can't learn anything maybe
  you can have a laugh instead. I'm told I'm pretty funny.
</p>
<p>
  I'm going to try to organize this into three main sections:<a href="/about.html"> About me</a> where I
  keep the stuff I'm working on and interested in. Expect the area to change
  frequently as I'm easily distracted by neat shiny <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn">new things</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Then there will be the <a href="/blog.html">Blawg</a> section where I just kind of dump my thoughts
  each evening as I wind up my coding for the day to prep for rest. Much of this
  content will likely be curated into the thrid and final primary section of
  this site, <a href="/topics.html">Topics.</a>
</p>
<p>
  For the Topics area, I'm going to try to line this up in a working order. For
  example: Getting your install media > etching it to a usb disk > booting from
  the USB disk > partition/swap management > partitioning > formatting (ext4,
  btrfs, swap) > mounting > installing > setting up the boot partition > account
  creation (you're still root up to this point, and do not just settle on using
  root, you'll do something dumb if you aren't reminded to type sudo before hand
  from time to time) > base video drivers > Xorg > Picom > Xrandr > and finally
  the golden window manager. From there we cover browsers > terminals > sweet,
  SWEET customization. I welcome your ideas for topics!
</p>

<p>
  Well I think it's time to pull the shades on this landing page for now and get
  to the real work of continuing to maximize the efficiency of my workflow so I
  can give you a juicy blog post tonight about all the nonsense I went through,
  and help you avoid the same nonsense when you pass through the same regions
  I'm in.
</p>

<p>TTFN, Love, JM</p>
