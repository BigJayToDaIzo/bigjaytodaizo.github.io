# About yaboi

Yo check this out, we busted out the gate towards Mordor, erm I mean[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org)and it is a grand thing we took such a HEARTY and DIVERSE party to deal with the dragon yo, but here we are. Let me take you on the adventure where I fought a dragon and won!

Stay tuned for actual information about me in the days to come. I want to spend roughly one hour each evening before bed organizing my thoughts, and I want to curate a[topics](/topics.html)section where folks looking for help can just head straight to[topics](/topics.html)and see what I (and others) have to say about various [topics.](topics.html) There are a plethora of[topics](/topics.html)to consider when building a custom linux build. But we will get into that in the days to come.

The first thing you should know about me is within my new passion for building personal developer environments with open source software, is that I'm now simping for Lua.
