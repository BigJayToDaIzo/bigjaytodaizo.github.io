# About yaboi

Yo check this out, we busted out the gate towards Mordor, erm I mean[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org)and it is a grand thing we took such a HEARTY and DIVERSE party to deal with the dragon yo, but here we are. Let me take you on the adventure where I fought a dragon and won!

Stay tuned for actual information about me in the days to come. I want to spend roughly one hour each evening before bed organizing my thoughts, and I want to curate a[topics](/topics.html)section where folks looking for help can just head straight to[topics](/topics.html)and see what I (and others) have to say about various [topics.](topics.html) There are a plethora of[topics](/topics.html)to consider when building a custom linux build. But we will get into that in the days to come.

Love, JM
